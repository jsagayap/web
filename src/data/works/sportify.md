Sportify is an e-commerce and social networking platform designed for sports enthusiasts. It offers a wide selection of sports products from various brands and manufacturers. In addition to shopping, Sportify provides a community space where fans can share their passion for sports. The 'Communities' feature allows users to personalize their experience and connect with like-minded individuals.

The project originally began as a group assignment with a static first version. The second version introduced a major redesign along with the addition of a backend, while the third version involved a complete overhaul. I was primarily responsible for the last two versions, handling everything from the website redesign to the development of the new backend.
